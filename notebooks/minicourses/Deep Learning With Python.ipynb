    "Theano is a Python library for fast numerical computation to aid in the development of deep learning models. At it’s heart Theano is a compiler for mathematical expressions in Python. It knows how to take your structures and turn them into very efficient code that uses NumPy and efficient native libraries to run as fast as possible on CPUs or GPUs.\n",

With the backing of Google, perhaps used in some of it’s production systems and used by the Google DeepMind research group, it is a platform that we cannot ignore. Unlike Theano, TensorFlow does have more of a production focus with a capability to run on CPUs, GPUs and even very large clusters.\n",

    "Lesson 3: Introduction to Keras\n",
    "------------\n",
    "A difficulty of both Theano and TensorFlow is that it can take a lot of code to create even very simple neural network models. These libraries were designed primarily as a platform for research and development more than for the practical concerns of applied deep learning. The Keras library addresses these concerns by providing a wrapper for both Theano and Keras. It provides a clean and simple API that allows you to define and evaluate deep learning models in just a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the ease of use and because it leverages the power of Theano and TensorFlow, Keras is quickly becoming the go-to library for applied deep learning. The focus of Keras is the concept of a model. The life-cycle of a model can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "1. Define your model. Create a Sequential model and add configured layers\n",
    "2. Compile your model. Specify loss function and optimizers and call the `compile()` function on the model.\n",
    "3. Fit your model. Train the model on a sample data by calling the `fit()` funciton on the model\n",
    "4. Make prediction. User the odel to generate predictions on new data by calling functions such as `evaluate()` or `predict()` on the model\n",
