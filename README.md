# Machine Learning Journey

This repo contains IPython notebooks I've created to experiment with libraries (e.g. scikit-learn numpy, scipy, matplotlib, ...) and work through exercises. My journey in Machine Learning is recorded here.

## Libraries

Here are my notebooks to experiment with popular "data science" Python libraries:

- [NumPy](notebooks/libraries/NumPy.ipynb)
- [SciPy](notebooks/libraries/SciPy.ipynb)


## Machine Learning Exercises

I re-implement all exercises in [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course on Coursera tought by Prof. Andrew Ng.

- [Exercise 1 - Linear Regression](notebooks/ml_andrew/Exercise 1 - Simple Linear Regression.ipynb)


## Deep Learning Exercises

I will put my notebooks for Tensorflow Deep Learning exercises here.
- [Assignment 1: notMNIST](notebooks/tensorflow/notebooks/tensorflow/Assignment_1_notmnist.ipynb)


## Big Data

Exercises on Big Data.


## Kaggle Competitions

Here are my notebooks for Kaggle Competitions

## Misc
Notebooks covering various interesting topics!
