# Machine Learning Journey

This repo contains IPython notebooks I've created to experiment with libraries (e.g. scikit-learn numpy, scipy, matplotlib, ...) and work through exercises. My journey in Machine Learning is recorded here.

## Libraries

Here are my notebooks to experiment with popular "data science" Python libraries:

- [NumPy](notebooks/libraries/NumPy.ipynb)
- [SciPy](notebooks/libraries/SciPy.ipynb)


## Machine Learning Exercises

I re-implement all exercises in [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course on Coursera tought by Prof. Andrew Ng.

- [Exercise 1 - Linear Regression](notebooks/ml_andrew/Exercise 1 - Simple Linear Regression.ipynb)
- [Exercise 2 - Logistic Regression](notebooks/ml_andrew/Exercise 2 - Logistic Regression.ipynb)


## Deep Learning Exercises

I will put my notebooks for Tensorflow Deep Learning exercises here.
- [Softmax](notebooks/tensorflow/Softmax.ipynb)
- [Assignment 1: notMNIST](notebooks/tensorflow/Assignment_1_notmnist.ipynb)


## Mini Courses

This lists notebooks of mini courses about machine learning I created along my Journey.

- [Deep Learning with Python](notebooks/minicourses/Deep Learning With Python.ipynb)


## Kaggle Competitions

Here are my notebooks for Kaggle Competitions

- Allstate Claims Severity: [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-claims-severity), [Notebook](kaggle/Allstate Competition.ipynb)

## Misc
Notebooks covering various interesting topics!
