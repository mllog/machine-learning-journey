# Machine Learning exercises

This repo contains IPython notebooks I've created to experiment with libraries (e.g. scikit-learn, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, ...) and work through the assignments from Machine [Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) on Coursera tought by prof. Andrew Ng.

You can see a live rendering of the notebooks in links belows:
